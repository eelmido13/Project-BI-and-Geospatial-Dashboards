# Utilities & Telecom Project Manager Dashboard

## Overview

This repository features dashboards developed in both Power BI and ArcGIS to highlight critical insights for project managers in the utilities and telecom sectors. These dashboards support decision-making by presenting actionable visualizations on project status, progress, timelines, risk assessments, resource allocation, and geospatial analysis.

## Features

- **Project Status Overview:** Track the progress of multiple projects at a glance.
- **Progress Analysis:** Visualize planned vs. actual progress and identify project delays or accelerations.
- **Timeline Tracking:** Monitor deadlines, milestones, and project schedules to ensure timely delivery.
- **Risk Assessment:** Identify projects at risk and visualize key risk factors.
- **Resource Allocation:** Analyze team and equipment utilization across projects.
- **Geospatial Insights (ArcGIS):** Map-based dashboards to visualize the spatial distribution of assets, project locations, risks, and resource coverage.
